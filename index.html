            <h2>Technical Writer</h2>

            <p>Often people say the thing they dislike most is learning, but I find learning new things and understanding how something works exciting. Writing has always been one of my favorite ways to communicate my thoughts, ideas, and unique stories. Combining these two passions, I can use my writing skills as a technical writer to share what I learn with others, helping people understand complex topics with easy-to-read documentation.</p>
    
            <p>I have a bachelor's degree in English with a focus on Professional and Technical writing. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to learn from others and work with others to create exceptional documentation that helps users accomplish their goals. I am dedicated to my work and determined to achieve. I'm excited to bring my work ethic and unique perspective to the workplace. </p>
            
            <p>I thrive in a team environment, or as an independent worker.</p>
